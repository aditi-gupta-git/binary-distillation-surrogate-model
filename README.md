# AI/ML Surrogate Modelling for Binary Distillation
Machine Learning Project to develop ML surrogate models to approximate the performance of a binary distillation column. Process data is generated using DWSIM, an open-source process simulator, by systematically varying key operating parameters to predict Distillate Purity and Reboiler Duty.

---

## üìå Project Overview
This project applies **AI/ML surrogate modelling** to replace computationally expensive process simulations (DWSIM) with lightweight regression models.  
Using the dataset generated from DWSIM simulations, multiple ML methods are trained and compared to capture the relationship between column operating conditions and output performance.

> üéØ **Goal:** Predict separation efficiency (xD) and energy demand (QR) accurately, and identify which operating conditions impact them most.

## üî¨ Methods Used

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Removed 66 duplicate rows (final dataset: 307 samples √ó 8 features)  
  - Checked for missing values (none found)  
  - Standard scaling applied to continuous features  
  - Encoding performed for categorical feature (`Feed_ThermalCondition`)  
  - Verified unit consistency for flowrates (kmol/h) and duties (kW)  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - **Univariate analysis:** Histograms & Boxplots for feature distributions and outlier detection  
  - **Bivariate analysis:** Scatterplots (xD & QR vs inputs) to identify correlations  
  - **Multivariate analysis:** Correlation Heatmaps & Pairplots to capture feature interactions  
  - **Key findings:**  
    - Distillate purity (xD) strongly correlates with **Reflux Ratio** & **Feed Mole Fraction**  
    - Reboiler duty (QR) strongly correlates with **Feed Flowrate**  

- **Model Building**
  - **Linear Regression** ‚Üí weak baseline, high bias  
  - **Polynomial Regression** ‚Üí improved fit but overfitting observed  
  - **Random Forest Regressor** ‚Üí robust, accurate, interpretable feature importance  
  - **AdaBoost Regressor** ‚Üí decent accuracy, moderate error  
  - **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)** ‚Üí high accuracy, but computationally expensive  
  - **XGBoost** ‚Üí best performer (R¬≤ > 0.9, lowest RMSE for both xD & QR)  

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
  - Used **RandomizedSearchCV** for ensemble models (RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost)  
  - Tuned parameters: number of estimators, tree depth, learning rate, etc.  
  - Incorporated into **pipelines** with preprocessing steps  

- **Model Evaluation**
  - Metrics: **R¬≤** (goodness of fit), **RMSE** (prediction error)  
  - Diagnostic plots:  
    - Residual plots ‚Üí check variance & bias  
    - Parity plots ‚Üí predicted vs actual (RF/XGBoost aligned closely with diagonal)  
    - Error distribution plots ‚Üí ensembles showed narrow, centered errors
